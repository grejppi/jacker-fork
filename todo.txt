This is an assorted, unmaintained, always outdated TODO list that I use to write down fixes, plans and ideas.

- player/jack:
    - jack transport support
    - LASH/LADI support

- global:
    - undo/redo
    - status bar

- pattern view:
    - fix borked measure
    - measure shows actual position of pattern in song
    - reposition play cursor on measure click
    - set loop begin/end in measure
    - status bar: display row, channel, param, value
    - split pattern at cursor (split into two)

- track header view:
    - mute/solo track
    - midi channel volume
    - midi bank/instrument
    
- song:
    - copy/paste
    - zooming controls
    - rename pattern
    - merge patterns (melt into one)
    - when creating new pattern & loop is enabled, make pattern span loop.
    - snap track to position, not delta (change measure, track position is borked)

- global keyboard commands:
    -

- song:
    - shift+left/right: multiselect prev/next pattern
    - shift+up/down: multiselect patterns across tracks
    - ctrl+left/right: expand/contract pattern
    - ctrl+up/down: move track up/down
    - ctrl+plus: add pattern after current one and select
    - alt+left/right/up/down: move pattern
    - F2: rename pattern

- new major features:
    - midi input recording
    - set song position on midi trigger
    - multiple loop sections
    - mute track events
    - split patterns
    - join patterns
    - jsongz: zipped jsong
    - MID export
    - resize event independent from pattern:
        - event longer than pattern: loop
    - multiple pattern views
